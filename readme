echo.c - write arguments to stdout using low-level system calls bypassing libc via direct svc instructions to the kernel

sleep.c - suspend execution for a specified number of seconds by directly invoking the nanosleep syscall using inline assembly without relying on libc

false.c - do nothing unsuccessfully by directly invoking the kernel exit syscall with status 1 using inline assembly and bypassing libc entirely

true.c - do nothing successfully by directly invoking the kernel exit syscall with status 0 using inline assembly and bypassing libc entirely
